# AdventureWorks SQL Project – Sales Overview (Q01–Q10)

This project is part of my SQL learning journey using the AdventureWorks sample database.  
I wanted to practice answering **real business-style questions** with SQL queries instead of just writing textbook examples.

## What This Project Shows
- How to write clear, well-structured SQL queries
- Working with multiple tables using JOINs
- Summarizing data with GROUP BY and HAVING
- Filtering, ordering, and limiting results
- Turning business questions into SQL solutions

## How to Run
1. Database: AdventureWorks2019 (also works on 2017).  
2. Open any `.sql` file in this repo using SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Data Studio.  
3. Run the query against the database. Each file is independent and labeled Q01–Q10.
